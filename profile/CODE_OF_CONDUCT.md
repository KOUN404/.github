These rules apply across all our platforms — GitHub, Discord, Reddit, and more.

### 1. Be Inclusive & Respectful

- Never share another person’s private information.
- Do not promote tracking, surveillance, or closed, proprietary solutions.

### 3. Zero Tolerance for Abuse
- No threats, bullying, or offensive language.
- Sexual harassment and personal attacks result in immediate action.

### 4. Stay On Topic (When Appropriate)

- No spamming, self-promotion, or advertising unless pre-approved.

### 5. Protect the Community
- Report bugs, vulnerabilities, or rule violations via direct message to moderators or by emailing our security contact.
- Help keep discussions productive and welcoming.

### 6. Celebrate Open Source Spirit
